# The SQUARE ERROR
<hr>
In the code, when you run the square, you get the wrong area and correct perimeter <br>
Upon inspecting the code, the area is calculated by multiplying width by width
which is wrong when calculating non square area such as width of 9 and height of 12.
<br>
to solve this, using width * height gives the correct area results
